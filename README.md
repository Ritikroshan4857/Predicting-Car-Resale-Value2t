# Predicting-Car-Resale-Value2t
# Car Resale Value Prediction

A machine learning project to predict car resale values using regression techniques.

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the resale value of cars based on features like make, model, year, mileage, and fuel type. The model is trained on historical car sales data and deployed as a REST API using FastAPI and Docker.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Random Forest regression model with hyperparameter tuning
- RESTful API for making predictions
- Containerized deployment with Docker

## Project Structure

- `research/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model prototyping
- `production/`: Production-ready code
  - `src/`: Source code
  - `models/`: Saved model files
  - `tests/`: Test scripts
- `data/`: Dataset storage (not included in repository)

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
